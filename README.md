# Capstone-Project

## Project Overview

The Legal SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platform is a cloud-based case management system built specifically for independent lawyers and small-to-medium law firms. Unlike large enterprise systems that are expensive and complex, this solution is affordable, scalable, and easy to use ‚Äî designed to meet the daily challenges of legal professionals who need to manage cases efficiently, communicate with clients securely, and handle large volumes of documents.

At its core, Legal SaaS combines three powerful components:
  - Case Management System (CMS): Centralizes all case-related data, deadlines, evidence, and documents in one place.
    
  - AI-Powered Legal Tools: Automates repetitive tasks like document reviews, contract analysis, and summarizing long files ‚Äî reducing time and human error.
    
  -  Client Communication Portal: Provides secure, real-time interaction with clients (chat, updates, document sharing), improving transparency and client satisfaction.

The platform is delivered as a SaaS model, meaning lawyers and firms can access it via web or mobile apps without needing to install or maintain servers. Everything is hosted on the cloud, and updates happen automatically.

## Problem Statement

Independent lawyers and small firms face several common challenges:
  - üìÇ Scattered Case Data: Many lawyers still rely on physical files, emails, and basic spreadsheets, making it hard to track deadlines and documents.
    
  - ‚è≥ Time-Consuming Document Reviews: Reviewing contracts, evidence, and case files manually takes hours ‚Äî time that could be spent advising clients.
  - üìû Inefficient Client Communication: Clients often complain about slow updates or lack of transparency on their case progress.
    
  - üí∏ High Cost of Enterprise Tools: Large firms use advanced systems, but they are too expensive and complex for smaller practices.

Legal SaaS directly addresses these problems by providing a cost-effective, intelligent, and user-friendly system.
